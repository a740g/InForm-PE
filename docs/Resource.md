# Resource Library

The `Resource` library provides functions to load binary data that has been encoded into Base64 strings. This is particularly useful for embedding resources like images, sounds, or other binary files directly into the source code.

These functions are designed to work with resources processed by the [Bin2Data](https://github.com/a740g/Bin2Data) utility, which converts binary files into embeddable Base64-encoded `CONST` or `DATA` statements.

## Usage

To use the `Resource` library, you need to include `Resource.bm` in your project.

### Loading from a Constant

If `Bin2Data` generated a `CONST` string, you can load it using `Resource_LoadBase64String`.

```vb
' Resource generated by Bin2Data
CONST SIZE_HELLO_TXT_BI_15 = 15~&
CONST COMP_HELLO_TXT_BI_15 = 0%%
CONST DATA_HELLO_TXT_BI_15 = "SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQoK"

DIM resourceData AS STRING
resourceData = Resource_LoadBase64String(DATA_HELLO_TXT_BI_15, SIZE_HELLO_TXT_BI_15, COMP_HELLO_TXT_BI_15)

' resourceData now contains the original binary content.

END

'$INCLUDE:'Resource.bm'
```

### Loading from DATA Statements

If `Bin2Data` generated `DATA` statements, you can load the resource using `Resource_LoadBase64Data`.

```vb
RESTORE data_hello_txt_bi_15
DIM resourceData AS STRING
resourceData = Resource_LoadBase64Data

' resourceData now contains the original binary content.

END

' Resource generated by Bin2Data
data_hello_txt_bi_15:
DATA 15,20,-1
DATA SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQoK

'$INCLUDE:'Resource.bm'
```

## API Reference

Loads a binary file encoded with `Bin2Data` from a `CONST` string.

**Parameters:**

* `src`: The Base64 `STRING` containing the encoded data.
* `ogSize`: The original, uncompressed size of the data in bytes.
* `isComp`: `_TRUE` if the data is compressed (requires inflation), `_FALSE` otherwise.

**Returns:**
The decoded (and optionally decompressed) binary data as a `STRING`.

```vb
FUNCTION Resource_LoadBase64String$ (src AS STRING, ogSize AS _UNSIGNED LONG, isComp AS _BYTE)
```

***

Loads a binary file encoded with `Bin2Data` from `DATA` statements. It reads the header and data chunks automatically after a `RESTORE` statement points to the correct `DATA` label.

**Returns:**
The decoded (and optionally decompressed) binary data as a `STRING`.

```vb
FUNCTION Resource_LoadBase64Data$
```
