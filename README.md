[InForm-PE](https://github.com/a740g/InForm-PE) is a GUI engine and WYSIWYG interface designer for [QB64-PE](https://www.qb64phoenix.com/). It is a fork of [InForm](https://github.com/FellippeHeitor/InForm), authored by [Fellippe Heitor](https://github.com/FellippeHeitor).

InForm-PE's main goal is to generate *event-driven* QB64-PE applications. This means that you design a graphical user interface with interactive controls and then write the code to respond to such controls once they are manipulated.

## FEATURES

- WYSIWYG interface designer
- Event-driven application design
- Works on Windows, Linux & macOS
- Everything is statically linked (no shared library dependencies)

## DOCUMENTATION

- [Wiki](https://github.com/a740g/InForm-PE/wiki)
- [Tutorial](https://raw.githack.com/a740g/InForm-PE/refs/heads/master/docs/tutorial/index.html)
- [INI-Manager](docs/INI-Manager.md)
- [GIFPlay](docs/GIFPlay.md)

## USAGE

Install InForm-PE and QB64-PE side-by-side in their own directories. There is no need to copy InForm-PE files to the QB64-PE directory.

> The following directory setup is recommended

```text
<some-drive-or-directory>
    |
    |-------<InForm-PE>
    |           |
    |           |-------<UiEditor[.exe]>
    |
    |-------<QB64pe>
                |
                |-------<qb64pe[.exe]>
```

Assuming your setup is like the above, do the following:

- Open Terminal and change to the InForm-PE directory using an appropriate OS command
- Run `setup_inform_lnx.sh`, `setup_inform_mac.command` or `setup_inform_win.cmd` depending on the OS you are on. This will run make with the correct parameters. If the build fails, ensure QB64-PE is installed in the **QB64pe** directory (next to the InForm-PE directory). If QB64-PE is installed elsewhere, then edit the setup scripts to change the location
- Once InForm-PE is compiled, you will find the UiEditor[.exe] executable in the InForm-PE directory
- Run UiEditor[.exe] to start designing your forms
- After your form looks the way you want it to, click **File > Save** to export its contents and generate a **.bas** source file. Two files are exported:
  - **.frm** - the generated form in QB64-PE code. This can be loaded back into InForm-PE's designer or manually edited in QB64-PE or any text editor later, if you want to adjust fine details
  - **.bas** - the actual program you will add your code to

***You add code to respond to events.***

- *Click*
- *MouseEnter/MouseLeave* (hover)
- *FocusIn/FocusOut*
- *MouseDown/MouseUp* (events preceding a Click)
- *KeyPress*
- *TextChanged* (for text box controls)
- *ValueChanged* (for track bars, lists and dropdown lists)

***There are also events that occur in specific moments, to which you can respond/add code.***

- *BeforeInit*, triggered just before the form is shown.
- *OnLoad*, triggered right after the form is first shown.
- *BeforeUpdateDisplay*, triggered every time the form is about to be repainted.
- *BeforeUnload*, triggered when the user tries to close the program, either via clicking the window's X button, right click in the task bar -> Close or with Alt+F4 (Windows only).
- *FormResized*, triggered when a form with the CanResize property is resized at runtime.

***IMPORTANT: The following files must be copied to your project directory for it to compile.***

```text
InForm/InForm.bi
InForm/InForm.ui
InForm/InFormCommon.bi
InForm/InFormVersion.bi
InForm/xp.uitheme
InForm/extensions/*.*
```
